    <h1>BEHIND YOUR MEMORY</h1>
    <h4>Designed by VIVIAN JI</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Imagine such a scene: A new guy starts working at your company. A week goes by, and you have a few uninteresting interactions. He seems nice enough, but you’re busy and not paying particularly close attention. On Friday, in the elevator, he asks you out. Suddenly, the details of all of your prior encounters resurface and consolidate in your memory. They have retroactively gone from unremarkable to important, and your brain has adjusted accordingly. Or, in a more negative guise, if you’re bitten by a dog in a new neighborhood, your memory of all the dogs that you had seen since moving there might improve. </p>
    <p>So, if memory for events is strengthened at emotional times, why does everyone forget what they were doing when the <i>"challenger"</i> of your memory exploded? While the memory of the event itself is enhanced, the vividness of the memory of the central event tends to come at the expense of the details. We experience a sort of tunnel vision, discarding all the details that seem incidental to the central event.</p>

    <p>Medical News Today spoke to Sam Berens, Ph.D., who is currently a research assistant at the University of York in the United Kingdom, and he explained to us that natural forgetting can be due to a few different reasons. <b>"Forgetting occurs because it would not be energy efficient to indefinitely maintain all the memories that we form each day. It also seems to be a natural consequence of neurogenesis — the process that creates new brain cells in support of future learning."</b> </p>
    <p>"Because of this, clearing <b>old and unused</b> memories may be directly related to our ability to learn <b>new things</b>," he told MNT. But scientists continue to explore the many complications that riddle memory recall and formation. For instance, not all our memories are correct, and sometimes our brains "implement" forgetting as a defense mechanism.</p>
    <p>"Memory conformity may also serve an adaptive purpose because social learning is often more efficient and accurate than individual learning," which is not always reliable. For instance, as studies have shown, the process of memory retrieval can mean that the original memory is rewritten — with the memory of that memory — so that the original memory becomes <i>warped</i></p>

    <p>In the Academy-Awards-winning film, <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,</i> the broken-up couple, Joel and Clementine, went to a clinic to take a surgery to erase the memory of each other in order to get rid of the pain and trauma that their break-up brought. Below is selected from the manuscript, describing how the surgery works, and the theory of memory behind it. </p>
    <p>“We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards - There is an <b>emotional core</b> to each of our memories - As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -  By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared.  Like a <i>dream upon waking.</i>”</p>
    <p>“Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss.”</p>
    <p>“We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.”</p>
    <p>“We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.  That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.”</p>
